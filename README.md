# Positivus Website – A Remake

## 🧭 Overview

This project is a remake of my initial attempt at transforming a web design into a functional website. With the knowledge and experience I’ve gained since then, I’m rebuilding it to reflect on past mistakes, improve the structure, and apply better development practices.

- **Original Design**: [Figma – Positivus Landing Page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1230604708032389430/positivus-landing-page-design)

> **Note**: The design is not mine; it's sourced from the Figma community.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Semantic HTML**: Utilize semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Clean Code**: Maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Deployment**: Host the project using Vercel for easy access and sharing.
